## Writing Filters

Adblock Plus Chromium (**ABP Chromium**) is a software development kit that you can use to integrate eyeo's ad-filtering technology into Chromium-based browsers.

Built from a fork of the [Chromium project](https://adblockplus.org/), ABP Chromium leverages eyeo's **something something something** to serve as the basis for developing your own browser.

You can get started with ABP Chromium SDK in just two stages:

1. Verify your Chromium dependencies.
2. Fork ABP Chromium from eyeo's GitLab repository.

By the end of this quickstart guide, you'll have cloned the ABP Chromium project and implemented a **somethng something** for further use.

## Verify Chromium dependencies

Because ABP Chromium is built from a Chromium fork, integrating ABP Chromium into your browser requires several Chromium dependencies.

You'll find the necessary dependencies within the `components` directory in eyeo's [ABP Chromium repository](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium). A successful integration requires the following dependencies:

- [KeyedService](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium/-/blob/eyeo-104-dev/components/keyed_service/core/keyed_service.h)
- [Network Service](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium/-/tree/eyeo-104-dev/services/network)
- [PrefService](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium/-/blob/eyeo-104-dev/components/prefs/pref_service.h)
- [Profile](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium/-/blob/eyeo-104-dev/chrome/browser/profiles/profile.h)
- [Resources](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium/-/tree/eyeo-104-dev/components/resources)
- [Version Information](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium/-/tree/eyeo-104-dev/components/version_info)

If you're unable to incorporate these (or any other) Chromium dependencies into your browser, the SDK might not perform as expected.

## Clone the ABP Chromium fork

You'll build your ABP Chromium project on top of eyeo's current fork. Follow these steps to clone the ABP Chromium GitLab repository:

1. **Copy the following URL:**

```html
https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium
```

2. **Clone the repository using the URL you just copied, then move in to the new ABP Chromium directory:**

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/eyeo/adblockplus/abpchromium
cd abpchromium
```

3. **Set ABP as the upstream repository, and set your repository as its origin:**

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin your-repository-path
```

4. **Create your development branch from the latest ABP Chromium release tag**:

```
git checkout -b my-branch eyeo-abp-release-101.0.4951.41-2.0
```

You can now develop and commit your project's changes to the branch you just created.

### Implement your changes

Most internet ads are web resources found at a URL. Suppose you come across ad content at the following URL:

```html
http://example.com/ads/banner123.gif
```

This URL contains two key components:

- A domain name, in this case `example.com`
- A path, in this case, `/ads/banner123.gif`

The path itself contains two components:

- A directory, or folder, in this case `/ads`
- A file inside that folder, in this case, `banner123.gif`

Next, you'll learn how to convert this URL into a filter.

### Turning the request into a filter rule

If you only wanted to block the file `banner123.gif`, you could instruct the browser to block the entire, unchanged URL. However, the file's parent folder, `/ads`, probably contains other ads that you could block as well. By making small changes to the URL, you can create a comprehensive filter rule that blocks `banner123.gif` and content similar to it, as well.

<!--#### Changing requests with special characters -->

For example, if you see a file named `banner123.gif`, you might conclude that the folder contains other files with similar names, like `banner456.gif` or `banner789.gif`. Instead of writing filter rules for each potential file, you could use the wildcard character `*` and replace the numbers following `banner`, like in the following example:

```html
http://example.com/ads/banner*.gif
```

This `*` character serves as a placeholder for any other characters that may follow, including numbers. This filter rule, then, would block all `.gif` files in the `/ads` folder that begin with the string `banner`.

You've now converted the resource's URL into a filter that Adblock Plus can use to block content.

### Adding your filter rule to Adblock Plus

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="For this step, make sure you have Adblock Plus installed on your device." />}}

Use the following instructions to complete the final step, adding your filter to Adblock Plus:

1. Copy the filter rule you created in the previous step.
2. In your browser, open Adblock Plus, then select the **Advanced** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **My Filter List** section.
4. Paste the filter rule from Step 1 into the **Search or add filter(s)** field.
5. Click the **+Add** button to confirm.

You've just added a custom filter rule to Adblock Plus.

## Next up

In this quickstart guide, you cloned the ABP Chromium project and . Adblock Plus makes use of several other filter types, as well. As a next step, read our [filter reference documentation](#) to learn how to write even more custom filter rules.
