## About ABP Chromium

To improve our understanding of cross-platform usage and versioning, ABP Chromium collects some user data. Because one of eyeo's driving principles is to respect user privacy, no requests sent to data collection services contain any personally identifiable information **(PII)**.

This page contains information on how and why eyeo implements user counting in ABP Chromium.

## Why we count users

We count users who have both ad-blocking **and** [Acceptable Ads scheme](https://acceptableads.com/) enabled, as well as those who only have ad-blocking enabled. We do this for the following reasons:

- Understanding user distribution across Chromium and SDK versions helps us decide which SDK versions to maintain and which we might deprecate.
- Understanding user distribution across operating systems and platforms (like mobile, desktop, gaming consoles, and so on) helps us prioritize quality assurance and automation efforts on the most popular platforms and OS versions.
- Understanding how users perceive Acceptable Ads, which we determine from their opt-out rate, contributes to the Acceptable Ads standard; we want to ensure that ads users see don't negatively impact user experience.
- User counting is the basis of payouts to partners who monetize their Acceptable Ads users.

## How user counting works

A ping request is sent automatically by the SDK to eyeo's dedicated service at least twice per day, if the browser is in use (including in the background) and ad-blocking is enabled. These pings don't contain any personally identifiable information.

### Ping request payload

To track which active clients while maintaining user privacy, the server combines the values of ping timestamps with a randomly-generated tag. Dates are truncated to further protect privacy.

The following table outlines the parameters sent with the ping:

| Parameter           | Type   | Optional | Description           |
|---------------------|--------|----------|-----------------------|
| `nonce`               | string |          | Number only used once, one of the algorithms that might be used to generate nonce is UUID4. This helps to anonymously distinguish between several ping requests with the same values for the rest of the parameters. |
| `addon_name`          | string |          | Identifier of the SDK integration. Example: `abpchromium` |
| `addon_version`       | string |          | Version corresponding to addon_name. Example: `2.0.0` |
| `application`         | string |          | Identifier of either hosting (partner's) application or product as sent by the client, for example, `chrome` |
| `application_version` | string |          | Version corresponding to application. Example: `86.0.4240.183` |
| `first_ping`          | string | ✅       | Timestamp of the first ping sent by the client and acknowledged by the server (as measured by the server), extracted from the first 2xx response body. Example: `2022-02-28T19:50:00Z` |
| `last_ping`           | string | ✅       | Timestamp of the last ping sent by the client and acknowledged by the server (as measured by the server), extracted from 2xx response body. Example: `2022-02-28T19:50:00Z` |
| `last_ping_tag`       | string | ✅       | Number generated by the client using UUID4 when it receives a response with a `last_ping`. Empty in the first message. If a ping is retried, the same `last_ping_tag` number should be used; this helps to anonymously distinguish between several ping requests with the same value of `last_ping`. |
| `previous_last_ping`  | string | ✅       | Timestamp of the previous to last ping sent by the client and acknowledged by the server (as measured by the server), copied from the last request. Example: `2022-02-28T19:50:00Z` |
| `aa_active`           | bool   |          | Whether the client opted into Acceptable Ads. |
| `platform`            | string |          | Client operating system. Example: `android` |
| `platform_version`    | string |          | Respective version corresponding to the OS. Example: `10` |
