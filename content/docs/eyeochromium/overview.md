## Overview

The eyeo Chromium SDK is a software development kit (**SDK**) that you can use to integrate eyeo's ad-filtering technology as a built-in feature into Chromium-based browsers.

Built as a fork of the original Chromium project, the eyeo Chromium SDK enables seamless integration without requiring users to install additional extensions or software, just the browser's binary.

The SDK supports desktop and Android platforms and providing a consistent experience across both by blocking disruptive video ads and pop-ups.

Because the eyeo Chromium SDK is fully integrated into a browser, limitations introduced by the Manifest V3 specification have no effect on it.

As you get started with implementing eyeo Chromium into your own projects, you'll find the following documentation useful:

- [eyeo Chromium quickstart](/docs/abpchromium/quickstart); a walkthrough of a basic eyeo Chromium installation
- [eyeo Chromium SDK features](/docs/abpchromium/abpfeatures); an in-depth guide to customizing eyeo Chromium
- [ADRs & FAQs](/docs/abpchromium/faq); the eyeo Chromium architectural decision records
- [Privacy and data collection](/docs/abpchromium/privacy); information on how eyeo protects user privacy
- [Tooling](#); guidelines for the tools you can use with eyeo Chromium
